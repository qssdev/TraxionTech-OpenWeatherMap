# TraxionTech-OpenWeatherMap
Consuming Web Services

1. Integrate with the API stated in https://openweathermap.org/current
2. Create one integration each for the JSON and XML formats
Ex. https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London
XML https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&mode=xml
3. Deserialize the JSON and XML response.
4. Read the API documentation for instructions on how to integrate with the APIs
5. You will need to create a free account to get an API key

--Note--
I save the api-key that i have use for you to test it directly
but in the real-world the api-key should not exposed to public.

I will deactivate the api key after 3 days.
